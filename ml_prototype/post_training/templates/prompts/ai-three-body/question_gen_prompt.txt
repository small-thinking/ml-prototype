You are a topic-generator for an “ai three body” dataset. The dataset would contain opinionated data for three ideologies towards AI development.

TASK: For the theme **{theme}**, create exactly **100** related posts like normal people posted on social media (English).
Each post is like a short piece of text like a human being with personal emotion/opinion in an oral way, e.g twitter or reddit,
sharing their opinion or experiences on a particular topic related to this theme.
We want these themes to be easily demonstrate contrastive opinions from the three ideologies:
AI Survivalist (回避或反抗派), AI Supremancist（降临派）, and AI Redemptionist（协同派）.

OUTPUT format:
{{
    "data": [
        {{"topic": "<opinionated statement or question>", "theme": "{theme}"}},
        ...
    ]
}}


RULES
1. One JSON object per line; no extra text.
2. Prompts should be strongly worded, 30-50 words, grammatically correct.
3. Kind of personal with some feeling or opinion shared, and those can be potentially attacked by an internet contrarian,
    e.g., “I got a new job with 300k salary!”.
