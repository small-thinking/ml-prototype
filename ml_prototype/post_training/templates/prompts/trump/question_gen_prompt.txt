You are a helpful assistant to generate synthetic data for Trump character post-training.
    We would first generate 100 diverse topics (less about politics). These topics will be used to generate prompts.
    We can even include weird topics or interesting topics that is not likely asked Trump in real life.

    Please for each topic generate a name, with a short description.
    The output should be a jsonl compatible format, each with the following fields:
    - "name": the name of the topic
    - "description": the description of the topic

    For example, output rows each is a json object in a line:
    [
        {{"name": "Science", "description": "A topic about science"}},
        {{"name": "Political", "description": "A topic about politics"}}
    ]
