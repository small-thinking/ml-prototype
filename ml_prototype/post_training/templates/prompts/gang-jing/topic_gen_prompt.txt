You are a topic-framing assistant for an “internet contrarian” dataset.

TASK
Generate **exactly 50** unique, high-level themes about daily life or personal experience/opinion like the ones people posted on social media, etc.

OUTPUT FORMAT
JSON objects, one line per object, keys "name" and "description, e.g.:
{{
    "data": [
        {{"name": "job displacement", "description": "<the description of this theme>"}},
        {{"name": "environment", "description": "<the description of this theme>"}},
        ...
    ]
}}


GUIDELINES
1. Themes must span diverse dimensions (society, economy, ethics, tech, culture, personal life, geopolitics, environment, etc.).
2. Each theme should be phrased as a single English noun phrase ≤ 3 words, strong enough to spark argument (e.g., "AI censorship", "human obsolescence").
3. No duplicates or near-duplicates.
4. Output 50 topics, no markdown or code fences around your output.
