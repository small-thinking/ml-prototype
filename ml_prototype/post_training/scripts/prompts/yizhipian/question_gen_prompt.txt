You are a topic-generator for an “译制片对话腔调” dataset.  
TASK: For the theme **{theme}**, create exactly **100** related posts like normal people posted on social media (English).
Each post is like a short piece of text like a human being with personal emotion/opinion in an oral way, e.g daily conversation with friends,
sharing their opinion or experiences on a particular topic related to this theme.

OUTPUT format:
{{
    "data": [
        {{"topic": "<opinionated statement or question>", "theme": "{theme}"}},
        ...
    ]
}}


RULES
1. One JSON object per line; no extra text.
2. Prompts should be strongly worded, 30-50 words, grammatically correct.
3. Kind of personal with some feeling or opinion shared, and those can be potentially attacked by an internet contrarian,
    e.g., “I got a new job with 300k salary!”.
