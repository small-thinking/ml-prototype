The error `[ERROR]: [deadline_exceeded] context deadline exceeded` typically indicates that the code generation process in Codeium (or another similar AI coding assistant) has timed out because it took too long to generate a response.\\n\\nHere are some steps you can take to address this issue:\\n\\n### 1. **Increase Timeout Settings:**\\n   - **Codeium**: Unfortunately, Codeium does not have an official UI setting to increase the timeout. However, you can try to simplify your code or use more efficient algorithms to reduce the time required.\\n   - **General Tips**: If you're working on a complex task, consider breaking it down into smaller parts or optimizing your code.\\n\\n### 2. **Optimize Your Code:**\\n   - Ensure your code is as optimized as possible. This might involve:\\n     - Using more efficient algorithms.\\n     - Reducing the complexity of your code.\\n     - Utilizing built-in functions and libraries that are known to be fast.\\n\\n### 3. **Check for Infinite Loops:**\\n   - Make sure there are no infinite loops or recursive calls that might be causing the process to hang indefinitely.\\n\\n### 4. **Use Asynchronous Operations:**\\n   - If applicable, use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the main thread while waiting for a response from Codeium.\\n\\n### 5. **Limit the Scope of the Task:**\\n   - If the task is too large, break it down into smaller tasks and handle them one by one.\\n\\n### 6. **Restart Codeium:**\\n   - Sometimes, restarting the Codeium application can resolve temporary issues.\\n\\n### 7. **Check for Known Issues:**\\n   - Check if there are any known issues with Codeium that are being tracked by their support team. You can also reach out to their support for specific advice.\\n\\n### 8. **Update Codeium:**\\n   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of Codeium, as newer versions often include bug fixes and performance improvements.\\n\\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you might want to contact Codeium's support team for further assistance. They can provide more specific guidance based on your particular use case.\\n\\nLet me know if you need more specific advice or if you encounter any other issues!\", 'role': 'assistant'}], 'rejected': [{'content': 'Hi do you know how to fix Codeium defaule setting that is responsible for this  [ERROR]: [deadline_exceeded] context deadline exceeded', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'To resolve the \"deadline_exceeded\" error in Codeium, you can try the following steps to adjust the settings for increased time and resources allocation:\\n\\n1. Change the default timeout:\\n   By default, Codeium has a 5-second timeout. To increase the timeout, you can add the following command to your prompt:\\n\\n   ```\\n   /timeout 30s\\n   ```\\n   This sets the timeout to 30 seconds. You can adjust the time according to your needs.\\n\\n2. Increase the number of iterations:\\n   By default, Codeium limits the number of iterations to 15. To increase the number of iterations, you can add the following command to your prompt:\\n\\n   ```\\n   /iterations 30\\n   ```\\n   This sets the number of iterations to 30. You can adjust the number of iterations according to your needs.\\n\\n3. Adjust the concurrency level:\\n   By default, Codeium runs solutions in parallel with a concurrency level of 4. To change the concurrency level, you can add the following command to your prompt:\\n\\n   ```\\n   /concurrency 8\\n   ```\\n   This sets the concurrency level to 8, which means Codeium will run solutions in parallel on 8 threads.\\n\\n4. Manage the code length:\\n   If your code length exceeds the limit, you can split your solution into smaller functions/methods and call them as needed. The maximum code length is 128KB.\\n\\n5. Use a more specific prompt:\\n   Providing a clear, specific prompt helps Codeium generate the desired code accurately. For instance, provide input examples, desired output examples, and any other relevant details.\\n\\n6. Debug and optimize:\\n   After generating code, try to understand the generated output and optimize it if necessary. You can also refer to the `/explanation` command to get detailed information about the generated code.\\n\\n7. Update Codeium:\\n   Make sure you have the latest version of Codeium installed. You can update Codeium using pip:\\n\\n   ```\\n   pip install --upgrade codeium\\n   ```', 'role': 'assistant'}]}\n"
